On Monday, 31st March, I started work experience at Red Hat. Although I was nervous coming in, however, as soon as the ice breaker started things started to feel better. I got a chance to meet new people. I also learned a lot more about Red Hat and its services and the importance of companies like Red Hat working behind the scenes on things we need in our daily lives, e.g, online banking. 

I spent a lot of the day talking with new poeple and also got to look around the Red Hat building. One thing I enjoyed about the day was the fact that we had longer breaks. I think this was important to have on the first day to get used to working and learning for the next few days. 

We also leraned about Agile and the importance of teamwork and communication. We put these skills to use by building potato heads based on a chosen team by our project manager. Our theme was Marvel. We were given two boxes with random items that we had to look though and source parts suitable for each team. Me and my team were quite lucky to have made five potato heads as we found many parts and pieces related to marvel to put together. 

Overall, my first day in Red Hat was very fun. I had a great time.

Today we started the day with a stand up telling everyone what we did the day before. This helped me learn how companies like Red Hat work efficiently on a team as each person has to give an update on what they did the day before and their progress so far.  We learned about GitHub and created our own accounts to login and write up daily blogs for the week. We wrote our first blog today on all the things we did on Monday.

Afterwards, we learned how to code with Python. This was interesting because although I have already used Python before I got the chance to expand my coding skills. The workshop was clear and easy to follow and I had a great time coding again. 

Next, we did a cybersecurity lesson: "How to Crack One Million Passwords." This was great way to learn about the importance of having a good password. The more passwords I cracked the more longer I had to wait for the results. I never finished the lesson as the wait time for 1 million passwords was simply too long. However, it was enjoyable and easy to code.

Overall, today was a great day and I am looking forward for the rest of the week.

This morning we started off with our stand up with Jennefer as ususal. Then we wrote our blogs for Tuesday. Doing the blogs is great because it lets s recall what happened the previous day and is a fantastic way to remember the week. 

After our blogs we listened to a talk about Cloud Computing from James. He talked about what it was, the history of computers and how muhc things have changed, as well as recent things like AI and what is yet to come in the future. We also learned about the type of jobs we can do if we work in acompany like Red Hat. 

Afterwards we did lessons of our own choice from cybersecurity. I tried something new and something I had done and enjoyed before: "How to Steal a Pizza."

Lastly, we were given and hour and a half to build our own rollercoasters with papercups, duck tape, and paper straws. This was a part of Agile and was so fun as we had to create a loop. My team's roller coaster won in the end but overallit was an excellent task to be communicative and creative. I had a great time building it.
